# Turnable &nbsp;·&nbsp; [🇷🇺 RU](README_RU.md)
Turnable is a VPN core that tunnels TCP/UDP traffic through [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) relay servers or via [SFU](https://bloggeek.me/webrtcglossary/sfu/) provided by platforms like VKontakte. Traffic mimics legitimate WebRTC media and is encrypted, multiplexed, and spread across multiple peer connections. The entire codebase is modular and can be freely extended to add new features or support more platforms.

---

## Features
1. Future-proof modular architecture
2. Full support for both TCP and UDP sockets
3. Tunneling through multiple peer connections to bypass ratelimits
4. Multiplexing to allow establishing multiple route connections
5. End-to-end encryption - forced for handshake, optional for data
6. Convenient user and route management with proper authentication
7. Overall more stable and less hacky implementation than others

## How it works
There are two methods of establishing a tunnel with a remote server that Turnable supports. Both of them allow to establish multiple TCP/UDP connections via multiplexing, with traffic being spread through multiple peer connections to bypass platform ratelimits.

<details>
<summary>Relay - tunnel via TURN with an intermediate</summary>

The client allocates a relay address on the platform's TURN server, connects to the Turnable server, and from there it forwards traffic to the configured destination. Simple and stable, but is usually heavily throttled and can be detected.

```mermaid

    participant App as Source
    participant TC as Turnable Client
    participant TURN as TURN Server
    participant TS as Turnable Server
    participant Dest as Destination

    TC->>TURN: Join call, allocate relay endpoint
    Note over TC,TS: Dedicated tunnel established

    loop Traffic
        App->>TC: TCP/UDP data
        TC->>TS: Relay
        TS->>Dest: Forwarded data
        Dest-->>TS: TCP/UDP data
        TS->>TC: Relay
        TC-->>App: Forwarded data
    end
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Direct Relay - direct tunnel via TURN</summary>

The client allocates a relay address on the platform's TURN server and connects to the destination server directly. Does not require a Turnable server. **⚠️ Not recommended and is dangerous to use.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Source
    participant TC as Turnable Client
    participant TURN as TURN Server
    participant Dest as Destination

    TC->>TURN: Join call, allocate relay endpoint
    Note over TC,Dest: Dedicated tunnel established

    loop Traffic
        App->>TC: TCP/UDP data
        TC->>Dest: Forwarded data
        Dest-->>TC: TCP/UDP data
        TC-->>App: Forwarded data
    end
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>P2P - fake screencast via SFU ⚠️ WIP</summary>

The client and server communicate through the platform's SFU, disguising all traffic as a screencast stream.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Source
    participant TC as Turnable Client
    participant SFU as SFU (VK)
    participant TSM as Server - Main Peer
    participant TSD as Server - Dedicated Peer
    participant Dest as Destination

    TC->>SFU: Join call, locate server main peer SSRC by username
    TC->>SFU: SDP response with main peer SSRC + start fake screencast
    TSM-->>TC: ready ack

    TC->>TSM: auth
    TSM-->>TC: auth ack + dedicated peer SSRC

    TC->>SFU: SDP response with dedicated peer SSRC
    TSD->>SFU: SDP response with client peer SSRC
    Note over TC,TSD: Dedicated tunnel established

    loop Traffic
        App->>TC: TCP/UDP data
        TC->>TSD: Relay
        TSD->>Dest: Forwarded data
        Dest-->>TSD: TCP/UDP data
        TSD->>TC: Relay
        TC-->>App: Forwarded data
    end
```

## Building
Pre-built binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/Turnable/releases). Pick the correct file for your OS and architecture.

If you would like to compile it yourself, run this command on the target machine:
```bash
go build -o turnable ./cmd
```

Check out the [ci.yml](https://github.com/TheAirBlow/Turnable/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow for cross-compilation.

---

## Setup
**Quick start:** Follow the [client](docs/client/SETUP.md), [server](docs/server/SETUP.md) or [service](docs/service/SETUP.md) setup guide. \
**Configuration:** Detailed reference for [client](docs/client/CONFIG.md) and [server](docs/server/CONFIG.md) config schemas.

> [!NOTE]
> If something broke after an update, most likely the configuration format has changed. You need to update it manually.
